# IOT-BASED-WEATHER-MONITARING-SYSTEM


🌦️ Project Showcase: IoT-Based Automatic Weather Monitoring System 🌐

Excited to share our latest team project, developed as part of our B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Asansol Engineering College! 🚀

🎯 What We Built:
A real-time Weather Monitoring System using the ESP32 microcontroller, designed to collect and display environmental parameters like:

🌡️ Temperature & Humidity (DHT11, DHT21)

🧭 Atmospheric Pressure (BMP280)

🌧️ Rain Detection (Rain Sensor)

💡 Light Intensity (LDR)

📺 Real-time Display on 16x2 LCD and mobile app (via Blynk)

🔋 Dual Power Supply: 12V Adapter + Solar Panel

📱 Integrated with a mobile app using Wi-Fi for remote monitoring, alerts, and real-time data display.

🔧 Key Features:

Modular and cost-effective design

Wi-Fi connectivity for mobile-based weather updates

Dual power system for reliability

Suitable for agriculture, environmental studies, and smart cities

🛠️ Tech Stack:

ESP32

Arduino IDE

Blynk IoT Platform

Sensors: DHT11, BMP280, Rain Sensor, LDR

LCD (16x2 with I2C)

7805 Voltage Regulator

🧠 What We Learned:
From integrating sensors and managing power efficiency to implementing Wi-Fi data transmission and mobile app interaction—this project taught us the full stack of IoT system design and deployment.
